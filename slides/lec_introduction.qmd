## Welcome to HPOL8539!

::: incremental
- You are the inaugural cohort!
- Course grew out of growing need to expand and de-mystify the "toolkit" of program and policy evaluation methods. 
:::

## The Dreaded Ice Breaker Questions

::: incremental
1. What research topics are you interested in / working on?
2. What method vexes you the most?
3. What do you hope to take away from this course?
:::


## Welcome to HPOL8539!

::: incremental
- Last 5 years have witnessed a **disorienting advancement** in methods for program and policy evaluation.
- The social sciences (naively) thought you could take basic panel data methods (e.g., fixed effects regression) and apply them to any "flavor" of policy intervention:
  1. Staggered treatment adoption.
  2. Scenarios with heterogeneous treatment effects.

## Welcome to HPOL8539!

::: incremental
- The goal of this course is to chart an intuitive path through recent advancements in policy evaluation  methods. 

- We'll spend quite a bit of time on DID and event study methods. 

- We'll also cover some other important new estimation approaches.

- We'll also cover statistical inference issues. 

::: 

## Guiding Principles for HPOL8539

::: incremental

- We will take our time and adapt as needed.

- The focus of the course will be on "proof by simulation." 

- By the end of the course you will have access to materials on all the topics.

  - Depending on our pacing, we may "decant" some of the methods from live class sessions to "blog" posts on the website.

## A Typical Causal Inference / Policy Evaluation Course

::: incremental
1. Read a bunch of econometrics before class.
2. See a bunch of econometrics flashed on slides during class.
3. Bang your head against the wall outside of class to code up and complete an assignment based on the econometrics.
:::

## How This Class Will Operate

::: incremental
1. Read some econometrics before class.^[Can't avoid the econometrics entirely!]
2. Collectively bang our heads against the wall by coding up a "live" case study during class. 
3. Assignments will focus on rigorously peer reviewing an unpublished research study, and writing up a methods section for a grant proposal, dissertation proposal, or research project. 
:::

## How This Class Will Operate 

::: incremental
- There are no formal lectures.  Only discussions, some white board work, and "live case studies." 

- I have "flipped" the class format in the sense that the hard-core econometrics will show up primarily in the readings. 
:::

## Guiding Principles for HPOL8539


- The case studies will be done in R, *but you will not need to be or become an advanced R programmer to do them!*^[I highly recommend becoming familiar with R / tidyverse methods, though!]

## Grading and Assignments

::: incremental
- 40% of student assessment is based on direct observation and engagement.

- 20% is basd on a written critique of a working paper that applies course methods to a current research topic (DUE: OCTOBER 19)

:::

## Grading and Assignments

::: incremental
- Remaining 40% is based on  written methods section for a proposed research study you aim to undertake during your dissertation (or afterwards). 

- There are two choices for the structure of this assignment:

  1. As an “Approach” section for an NIH/AHRQ grant application
  2. As a methods section for a research study or PhD dissertation proposal. 
  3. Alternative structures may be pursued after consultation with Dr. Graves, and with his permission.  
:::

## Grading and Assignments

::: incremental
- Three weeks in advance of the final written methods section being due (on December 8), you will submit a draft to a peer reviewer in the course (November 16)

- You will also be a peer reviewer for another student's work. 

:::

## Grading and Assignments

::: incremental
- 15 percentage points (of the 40% total for the assignment) will be based on your written assessment of your peer's work. This will be due to them (with a copy to me) on December 1. 

- Based on this feedback, you will revise your methods writeup and submit a final version on December 8. This final writeup will be worth 25 percentage points (of the 40% total for the assignment).

- Make sense? 
:::

## Grading and Assignments

::: incremental
- The guiding principle for this assignment structure is to unearth much of the "hidden curriculum" that often goes untaught in graduate school. 

  1. You will be called upon often to be a peer reviewer.
  2. The audience for a grant reviewer and for a peer reviewer are *different* and you should learn how to write for both. 
  3. You will often circulate your research to trusted peers for comments before formally submitting for publication.
