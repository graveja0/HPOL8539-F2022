- (Bio)statisticians and social scientists mean different things when they say "random" and (especially) "fixed" effects. Ugh.

- I will almost always refer to things from the social science angle.

- I'll try to tease out the intuition for what each discipline is referring to in the next few slides.

## The most important thing to know

> How do we think about unit level heterogeneity and its (statistical) relationship to the included (observed) variables in our regression model?



## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

- We're interested in the relationship between some unit-level factor $X$ and our outcome $Y$.

- Units in our data have attributes or factors that we inherently care about for our research or evaluation, such as whether they received treatment or not. 

- Treatment may not be explicit (i.e., randomized binary treatment), but rather could be some unit-level attribute or exposure (e.g., an individual's diet, education, etc.) and we want to understand the relationship between this implicit "treatment" and the outcome.

## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

- These unit-level **factors that are of inherent interest** to our study are referred to as "fixed effects" by statisticians.

- Let's take the example of the effect of diet on health outcomes. 
  
    - We collect longitudinal patient data on diet and outcomes from various different physician practices. 
    
- Our encoded measure of "diet" is the envisioned "treatment" and we want to understand the relationship between diet and health outcomes.

    - The effect of our encoded diet measure on outcomes is a "fixed effect" in statistical parlance. 
    

## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

- But in our quest to estimate this fixed effect, we likely have endogeneity/omitted variables that may arise from additional unit-level heterogeneity. 

- Example: physicians have various levels of engagement with their patients on their dietary habits. 

- One unit of analysis in our data is physicians (since we sample from patients in various physician practices). 
  
- But we're really not interested in the effect of one physician vs. another on outcomes, so this variation in our data is not really of inherent interest to us. 
    
- We still need to account for it though, because failing to will  confound our estimated effects. 

## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

- Also remember we have **panel data**, or repeated (longitudinal) measures on our units of interest.

- Usual regression assumes each observation in our data is the result of an independent draw from the population of interest.

- But this assumption (likely) fails here because we observe each person more than once!  

- Therefore, observations are also likely correlated within persons.


## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

- Repeated measurements within various units (e.g., time) results in "pseudoreplication," or the fact that even though our data are $N*T$ rows long, we likely have an effective sample size closer to $N$. 

- Same logic could hold for different patients who see the same physician -- are they really truly independent from each other? If physicians impact both diets *and* health outcomes, we may have an effective sample size less than that!

  - These types of considerations are a key motivation for the use of hierarchical modeling---you can take entire courses on this, so I will only tease it here!

## Fixed vs. Random Effects: The Statistics Angle

::: columns 
::: {.column width="50%"}
- We need some additional way to account for these features in our panel data. 

- This is where the statistical concept of "random effects" comes in. 

- These effects capture unit-level heterogeneity, but are not really of inherent interest. 

- If heterogeneity is an unobserved confounder, failing to account for it results in the figure on the top-right. Accounting for heterogeneity can help us get the (correct) relationships, as shown on the bottom right.

- And even if it's not confounding the relationships, we still have this concern over pseudoreplication to worry about---this would throw our inferences off (standard errors that are too low)

## Econometric Fixed Effects

- We'll now start to walk towards the econometric differentiation of a "fixed" effect.

- We can do this by finding some common ground on "random" effects. 

- Again, it boils down to modeling unit-level heterogeneity.

# Fixed and Random Effects

- Panel data structure: $n$ units ( $i$ ) and $T$ time periods ( $t$ )

- Binary (time-varying) policy indicator $D_{it}$ and outcome $Y_{it}$.

- Time-varying covariates $X_{it}$.

- Regression:

$$
Y_{it} = X_{it}'\beta + \tau D_{it} + U_i + \epsilon_{it}
$$

- Note that I'm ignoring the physician-level heterogeneity for now. 

## Fixed and Random Effects

$$
Y_{it} = X_{it}'\beta + \tau D_{it} + U_i + \epsilon_{it}
$$

- Remember our (confounding) friend $U$? There it is in the model!

- Notice how it is only indexed by $i$ and not $it$?
  
    - That means that *within* units (patients) in our panel (time) it remains ... **fixed**!
    
    - This is what econometricians meand by a "fixed effect."
    
    - Confusing, no?


## Fixed and Random Effects

- Ok, so now we have differentiated between what statisticians mean by "fixed effects" and what social scientists mean by "fixed effect"

- But again, lets focus on that individual heterogeneity term $U_i$.

- This heterogeneity is "fixed" but may be unobserved. 

- We need to account for it in some way, either because it is correlated with treatment (i.e., is a confounder) and/or because it allows us to account for pseudo-replication in our data (i.e., correlated observations within units). 


## Key Question

> How strong a set of assumptions are we willing to place on the statistical relationship between $U_i$ and what is observed (i.e., $X_{it}$ and $D_{it}$)?

- Let's think of $U_i$ as a summary measure capturing all fixed attributes of the unit.
